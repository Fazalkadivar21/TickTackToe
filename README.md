**Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

---

### **Project Description**

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

### **Features**

- **Two Players**: The game is designed for two players, denoted as "X" and "O".
- **Winning Combinations**: The game checks for 8 possible winning combinations.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time using the restart button.

### **Technology Stack**

- **HTML**: To create the structure of the game board.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the game board and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: To handle game logic, player turns, and win conditions.

### **How to Play**

1. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
2. Click on any square to place your mark ("X" or "O").
3. Players alternate turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. To start a new game, click the "Restart" button.

### **Future Improvements**

- Add a score tracker to keep count of how many games each player has won.
- Implement an AI opponent to play against the computer.
- Enhance the UI with more sophisticated styling and animations.
